            <h1>CIA as the source of most of our external and internal trouble</h1>
            <img src="images/spy_siluette.jpg" alt="Scott Sampson">
              <p>They say, "What you don't know, can't hurt you". The famous last words of those who died 
              because of some vital piece of information they didn't know. And there are many.</p>
              <p>So what do we know about the CIA? If you were to believe the Hollywood - it's an organization 
              filled with competent and shrewd spies whose jobs whilst they are fighting for our democracy against
              the Universal evil, are rather romantic and interesting.</p>
              <p>Nothing is further from the truth. For the last eighty years, even though the CIA has managed 
              to maintain a formidable reputation in spite of its terrible record, it was simply burying its 
              blunders in top-secret archives. Its stated mission was to know the world. When it did not succeed, 
              (not that it tried much) it set out to change the world. Its failures have handed us, in the words 
              of President Eisenhower, "a legacy of ashes."</p>
              <p>What brought about this legacy of ashes was (and is) a group of bumbling idiots who could not 
              get a single thing right and got almost everything wrong. This group had spent tremendous amounts of 
              money to nefarious ends and a failure as the result in most cases, as evidenced by numerous bloody 
              dictators it brought into power all over the world; as well as several terrorist organizations 
              it helped to create and finance.</p>
              <p>Internally in the US, this is the organization behind torture, kidnappings, assassinations, modern 
              lying media and dissembling bureaucracy, drug epidemics; and externally - it's behind coups d'Ã©tat and 
              broken economies, resulting in floods of refugees arriving en masse to both Europe and the United States. 
              CIA keeps working on changing the world forever towards its dog-eat-dog jungle ideal. If the public knew 
              the real face of this grievously anti-social organization, it would have caused a serious disruption to 
              the current political order of the country because almost everyone at the top is involved in what they do, 
              willy-nilly.</p>
